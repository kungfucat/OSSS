The School Motto "Vidhya Dadati Vinyam" is a vivid reflection of the mettle that goes into the making of an institution. It is a constant reminder that Education, which is the ultimate goal of progress, ennobles us and makes us learn to live in all humility. It enthuses us to be polite and courteous to all the living beings.</p><br>
      <h1><center>About Us</center></h1>
      <img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="images/float_right.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>Oxford Senior Secondary School—a co-educational institution was established in 1970 under the Patronage of Hansraj Prabhakar Educational Society. Vision and foresight is the difference between any institution and the great ones. Two pairs of eyes—Late Dr. C. P. Prabhakar and Late Smt. Kiron Prabhakar (Our Founders)—renowned educationists, saw this vision and with their hard work, grit and determination, set out to place a foundation for the future. They invested their sweat and blood into the most important people in the world—children-and Oxfordians are their harvest. Their relentless service and dedication to the cause of education has been instrumental in leading Oxford to its present glory.</p>
        <br>
            <h1><center>RECOGNITION &amp; AFFILIATION</center></h1>
      <p>The school is recognised by the Directorate of Education, Delhi Administration, and has been affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education provisionally since 1984 and is affiliated upto 31st March 2018. Today Oxford has become an institution catering to the masses with outstanding achievements in all spheres of curriculum.</p>
        <br>
                 <h1><center>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</center></h1>
      <p>Oxford Senior Secondary School strives to meet the challenging need of providing comprehensive education to develop the various aspects of a child's personality. It is our aim to impart education to children on the most modern lines, to provide an environment most congenial to the growth and development of children.
            </p><p>
        The school aims at providing the best education available in some of the best schools of Delhi and further arouse in them a keen thirst for knowledge and learning. It endeavours to foster and develop in children the habit to think clearly and independently and the capacity to express themselves effectively and unambiguously.
        </p>
        Emphasis is laid on character building, self-discipline and the development of the creative and social faculties.
        <p>
        Through the course of studies that are followed in the school, through the system of students' participation in the running of the school and through the various co-curricular activities that children are encouraged to take up, the school aims at producing well-informed and self-assured young men and women just the kind of citizens that our country so urgently needs.
